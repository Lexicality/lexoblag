Hi. I'm Lex and I'm a <span itemprop="jobTitle">programmer</span> from <span itemprop="homeLocation">London, UK</span>.

I play and build games in my spare time and currently work full time as an engineer for <a href="https://www.lyst.co.uk/about/" itemprop="worksFor">Lyst</a>.
<br>
I'm a big fan of the web and my favourite tools for working in it are <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> and <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, but Lua will always hold a special place in my heart.
