This is planned to be an informal collection of posts about [my projects](/blog/tag/project/) and [how to solve problems I couldn't sove with Google](/blog/how-to/).

I make no promises about how often I'll update it, but there's an [ATOM feed](/blog/feed.xml) and an [archive](/blog/archive/) available if you want them.

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a [custom theme](https://github.com/lexicality/website)
