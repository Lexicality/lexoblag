<p>
	This is an archive of every project I've started that I thought it was worth
	writing down.
</p>
<p>
	Some projects may get a few paragraphs of information, others will have
	multiple blog posts, images etc. I'm afraid it entirely depends on how old
	the project is and how much work I've actually put into it.
