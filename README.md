# Lexi's Blog Theme

This is my vain attempt to get [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to look and
act like a useful blogging system.

My apologies in advance for the horrors you will witness in the liquid source
files. Please accept my excuse that everything's compiled ahead of time so
taking 2 seconds to compile one template doesn't actually matter in terms of
page performance.

While writing this theme made me start pining for the fjords of Wordpress and
alcoholic oblivion, I'm quite pleased with the results.

You can see it in action on my website [lex.me.uk](https://lex.me.uk)
